# Blockchain-Based-Authentication-Scheme-with-Transferability

1. **Nonce** The `Nonce.c` file contains code for generating and managing nonces (numbers used once). Nonces are typically used in encryption and authentication protocols to prevent replay attacks and ensure the uniqueness of each operation.
2. **Hashchain** The `Hashchain.c` file contains code related to hash chains. A hash chain is a series of values linked together through a hash function, where each value is the hash of the previous value.
3. **SC_ECDSA** The `SC_ECDSA.sol` file contains smart contract code related to the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for implementing authentication and authority transfer.
4. **SC_VK_Fixed** The `SC_VK_Fixed.sol` file contains smart contract code related to the implementation of fixed verification keys for authentication and authority transfer.
5. **SC_VK_Update** The `SC_VK_Update.sol` file contains smart contract code related to the rolling update of verification keys for implementing authentication and authority transfer.
